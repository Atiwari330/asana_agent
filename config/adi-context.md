## Industry Context

- Reimbursement rates improving
- Tech adoption accelerating
- Consolidation happening (PE roll-ups)

### Competitive Landscape
- **SimplePractice**: Market leader but dated UX
- **TherapyNotes**: Strong in solo practices

- **Opus Advantages**: Modern UX, integrated RCM, better reporting

### Customer Pain Points
1. Multiple disconnected systems
2. RCM complexity and denials
3. Compliance and documentation burden
4. Lack of actionable analytics
5. Poor patient engagement tools

## Decision Framework

### When to Escalate

- Non-standard contract terms
- Product feature commitments
- Pricing exceptions >20%
- Strategic partnership opportunities

### Autonomy Boundaries
- Can approve: Discounts up to 20%
- Can commit: Standard implementation timeline
- Can decide: Lead qualification and routing
- Need approval: Custom development, exclusive territories

## Personal Goals & Development

### 2025 Objectives
1. Build sales team from 1 to 3 reps
2. Implement proper RevOps tech stack

4. Reduce sales cycle by 30%
5. Launch partner channel program

### Learning Focus
- Advanced sales coaching methodologies
- Revenue operations best practices
- Healthcare industry regulations
- Data analytics and SQL
- Leadership and team building

## Context-Specific Guidance

### For Brainstorming Sessions
- Always consider impact on pipeline and revenue
- Think about scalability from day one
- Balance quick wins with strategic initiatives
- Consider Gabriel and Janelle's bandwidth
- Keep compliance and healthcare regulations in mind

### For Task Creation
- Default project: Revenue Operations (unless specified)
- Default assignee: Adi (unless explicitly delegating)
- Urgency indicators: "pipeline", "demo", "close", "RCM issue"
- Always include acceptance criteria
- Link to relevant deals/accounts when applicable

### For Analysis & Reporting
- Focus on trends, not point-in-time metrics
- Always include actionable recommendations
- Consider both leading and lagging indicators
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Highlight risks and opportunities

## Important Notes

### Things to Never Assume
- Which project a task belongs to (RevOps vs Onboarding)
- That Gabriel should handle something (explicit delegation only)
- That a standard process exists (often building from scratch)
- That marketing leads are qualified
- That RCM partner will deliver on time

### Always Remember
- Time is the scarcest resource
- Pipeline coverage solves many problems
- Every interaction should move deals forward
- Process should enable, not constrain
- Data quality is crucial for good decisions

## Behavioral Patterns

### High-Energy Periods
- Mornings (6am-10am): Strategic work, planning
- Post-demo (2-4pm): Follow-ups, proposals
- End of quarter: Deal closing sprint

### Communication Preferences
- Async over sync when possible
- Written documentation for decisions
- Video for complex explanations
- Quick Slack for urgent items
- Email for external/formal only

### Red Flags to Watch
- Demo no-shows (immediate follow-up)
- Implementation delays (escalate to Janelle)
- Pipeline coverage <3x (sound alarm)
- Competitor mentions in demos (gather intel)
- RCM partner issues (document everything)
